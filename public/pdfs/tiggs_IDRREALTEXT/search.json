["LETTERS A tunable synthetic mammalian oscillator Marcel Tigges 1 , Tatiana T. Marquez-Lago 1,2,3 , Jo ¨rg Stelling 1,2,3 & Martin Fussenegger 1 Autonomous and self-sustained oscillator circuits mediating the periodic induction of specific target genes are minimal genetic time-keeping devices found in the central and peripheral circadian clocks 1,2 . They have attracted significant attention because of their intriguing dynamics and their importance in controlling critical repair 3 , metabolic 4 and signalling pathways 5 . The precise molecular mechanism and expression dynamics of this mammalian circadian clock are still not fully understood. Here we describe a synthetic mammalian oscillator based on an auto-regulated sense–antisense transcription control circuit encoding a positive and a time-delayed negative feedback loop, enabling autonomous, self-sustained and tunable oscillatory gene expression. After detailed systems design with experimental analyses and mathematical modelling, we moni-tored oscillating concentrations of green fluorescent protein with tunable frequency and amplitude by time-lapse microscopy in real time in individual Chinese hamster ovary cells. The synthetic mam-malian clock may provide an insight into the dynamics of natural periodic processes and foster advances in the design of prosthetic networks in future gene and cell therapies. Synthetic gene circuits that emulate the expression dynamics of living systems provide new insights into the connectivity of genes and proteins in the postgenomic era 6 and they advance our understand-ing of complex control networks. Circadian pacemakers 7,8 are of particular interest because they coordinate many periodic physio-logical activities. The mammalian circadian clock consists of a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of mammalian brains 9 , with subsidiary oscillators in most peripheral cell types 4,5,10 . In contrast to neurons in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, peripheral oscillators damp rapidly when disconnected from remote control by the suprachias-matic nuclei 10 . However, both oscillators rely on a very similar gene circuitry that involves a set of transcriptional repressors (CRY and PER) and activators (BMAL1 and CLOCK) connected by mutual feedback 11 . Previously designed simple synthetic gene networks in bacteria showed self-sustained 12 , damped 13 or metabolically con-trolled oscillations 14 , but those oscillators lacked robustness and/or tunability. In mammalian cells, even synthetic clock replicas using natural components and network design have not provided oscil-lating transgene expression 15 as observed for reporter genes plugged 1 Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Mattenstrasse 26, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland. 2 Institute of Computational Science and 3 Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, ETH Zurich, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland. 0 20 40 60 0 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 Time (h) mRNA concentration ( μ M) 0 20 40 60 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Time (h) Protein concentration ( μ M) P hCMV*–1 PIT P hCMV*–1 dGFP P hCMV*–1 tTA P PIR P hCMV*–1 PIT P hCMV*–1 dGFP P hCMV*–1 tTA P PIR P hCMV*–1 PIT P hCMV*–1 dGFP P hCMV*–1 tTA P PIR P hCMV*–1 PIT P hCMV*–1 dGFP P hCMV*–1 tTA P PIR pMT100 pMT36 pMT35 2 3 1 4 b a d c P hCMV*–1 P hCMV*–1 P hCMV*–1 PIT PIT PIT sense P PIR tTA tTA antisense dGFP GFP sense tTA sense tTA mRNA duplex GFP I GFP A D D D D D D D D TC TC TC TC TL TL TL D Folding Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø Tc Tc Tc PI tTA Figure 1 | Mammalian clock components and predicted oscillation dynamics. a , Core mammalian oscillator.

This sug-gested that important details on how cellular clocks operate are still unknown. Our synthetic core oscillator (Fig. 1a) consists of a sense–antisense expression unit encoding the tetracycline-dependent transactivator (tTA) 16 . tTA manages its sense transcription by means of an auto-regulated feedback loop controlled by the tTA-specific tetracycline-responsive promoter (P hCMV * -1 ;P hCMV * -1 R tTA; pMT35). Antisense transcription of tTA is driven by the pristinamycin-responsive pro-moter (P PIR ;P hCMV * -1 R tTA r P PIR ; pMT35) and triggered by the pristinamycin-dependent transactivator (PIT) 17 , whose expression is induced by P hCMV * -1 and thus feedback controlled by tTA (P hCMV * -1 R PIT; pMT36). tTA levels can be examined by tTA-specific P hCMV * -1 -driven expression of a fluorescent protein. For reasons given below, we used either the destabilized enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (d2EYFP; P hCMV * -1 R d2EYFP; pBP282 (ref. 18); see Supplementary Information) or the green fluorescent protein (GFP) variant Ub V76 –GFP (P hCMV * -1 R Ub V76 –GFP; pMT100), which have different half-lives. The network can be fine-tuned by modulating sense expression of tTA and PIT by tetracycline and by adjusting tTA antisense transcription by pristinamycin I (PI). In the absence of antibiotics P hCMV * -1 and P PIR are fully induced. To analyse whether the circuit could function as a genetic oscillator, we developed a first deterministic mathematical model (see Supplementary Information). It describes in a simplified yet mecha-nistic fashion the processes shown in Fig. 1b. Biologically plausible model parameterization demonstrated the oscillatory capacity of the mammalian circuit (Fig. 1c, d). It can undergo autonomous and self-sustained oscillation of tTA expression by alternating the induction of tTA by means of its autoregulated feedback (tTA induces its own expression), with time-delayed repression of tTA mediated by the two-level tTA antisense transcription cascade (tTA triggers PIT express-ion; PIT then induces tTA antisense expression). The antisense-mediated decrease in tTA levels triggers the recovery of tTA sense expression and, hence, a second clock cycle. A first oscillator implementation with the d2EYFP reporter pro-vided evidence that the basic design could function in vivo (see Supplementary Information). For detailed circuit design, we adapted the model parameters to the experimental d2EYFP time courses from oscillating cells and controls. The refined model enabled us to make a semiquantitative description of the circuit behaviour by capturing all qualitative dynamic features, but not all quantitative aspects (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Information). With the experimentally constrained model, we conducted simulation studies with varying model parameters and/or inputs to establish critical design features. The model predicted that the circuit should be robust to variations in protein and messenger RNA degradation and that the antibiotics may switch the oscillator on or off but not tune its beha-viour gradually (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Notes). Moreover, model analysis suggested that the synthetic network could sustain autonomous oscillations only at specific relative levels of the individual clock components (Fig. 2a, b). These levels are influenced by the relative amounts of expression vectors used to transfect mammalian cells 19 . The model predicted that, even when the ratios of oscillator components were held constant, absolute plasmid con-centrations could be used to modify the period and amplitude of the oscillations (Fig. 2a, b). More intuitively, destabilization of the reporter was predicted to increase the relative signal amplitude (Fig. 2b, c). The model-based analysis therefore pointed to reporter stability and gene dosage as key variables for optimizing the circuit. To reveal any rhythmic transcription control in single cell-based time-lapse microscopy studies, we implemented a second-generation oscillator by functionally plugging in a P hCMV * -1 -driven GFP variant engineered for a decreased half-life of a few minutes (Ub V76 –GFP; pMT100, P hCMV * -1 R Ub V76 –GFP). Co-transfection of pMT35 (P hCMV * -1 R tTA r P PIR ) and pMT100 resulted in a steady increase in green fluorescence, indicating that sense tTA was co-inducing its own expression as well as that of Ub V76 –GFP (Supplementary Fig. 3a). We observed a similar increase in Ub V76 –GFP expression after co-transfection of pMT100, pMT35 and pMT36 (P hCMV * -1 R PIT) when transfected populations were cultivated in the presence of PI, which inactivated PIT and prevented tTA antisense expression (Supplementary Fig. 3b). When the same population was exposed to tetracycline, Ub V76 –GFP expression was gradually shut off as a result of tTA inactivation (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Ub V76 –GFP expression was also shut off when co-transfecting pMT100 and pMT35 with the con-stitutive PIT expression vector pMF156 (P hCMV R PIT) 17 , which con-firmed that PIT-mediated induction of P PIR -driven tTA antisense expression outcompetes autoregulated tTA expression (Supple-mentary Fig. 3d). The individual feedback loops therefore operated as expected. To test the complete synthetic oscillator we co-transfected pMT35, pMT36 and pMT100 at various ratios. Ratios of 2:1:1 or 3:1:1 resulted in imbalanced expression of clock components and constant express-ion of Ub V76 –GFP (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). When pMT35, pMT36 and pMT100 were co-transfected at equimolar ratios (100 ng each) into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells cultivated without anti-biotics, we observed spontaneous, autonomous, self-sustained and robust oscillations of Ub V76 –GFP fluorescence in single cells (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Video). The oscillations could only be disturbed deliberately by adding either tetracycline or PI (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c), or by constitutive PIT expression (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Fast Fourier transformation-based analysis (see Supplementary Information) of at least 20 CHO-K1 cells with oscillating Ub V76 – GFP expression collected from four independent experiments showed that oscillations occur at a frequency of 170 6 71 min (mean 6 s.d.), with an amplitude of 1.81 6 1.96 fluorescence units (Fig. 3). The oscillations of the synthetic clock showed substantial variability between individual cells, even adjacent ones, suggesting that there is no functional coupling between oscillating cells. Next, to check the model predictions on gene-dosage-dependent oscillator behaviour, we varied the DNA doses used for transfection. In comparison with the oscillations generated by co-transfection of 100 ng pMT35, pMT36 and pMT100 (Fig. 3), co-transfection of 200 ng of each clock vector resulted in oscillation with a higher frequency (period of 147 6 58 min) but a reduced amplitude Relative dosage of pMT36 0.5 1.0 2.0 0.5 1.0 2.0 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 Relative dosage of pMT35 0.5 1.0 2.0 0.5 1.0 2.0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0.5 1.0 2.0 0.5 1.0 2.0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 b c a Figure 2 | Systems behaviour depending on gene dosage as predicted by the adapted model with variable transfection times.

When the plasmid doses were decreased to 50 ng each, the oscillation period increased (328 6 162 min) and the amplitude decreased (0.96 6 0.63 fluorescence units) (Fig. 4b), which confirms the model predictions on the tunability of the syn-thetic clock. Quantitative statistical analysis of single-cell data for various plasmid dosages revealed the dependences between gene dosage and oscillator frequency and amplitude shown in Fig. 4c, d. We used these experimental data together with the control experi-ments to establish a structurally refined mathematical model that could describe all experimental data quantitatively (see Supple-mentary Information). This deterministic model predicted non-intuitive relations between gene dosage and oscillator behaviour (Fig. 4c, d). Thus, our model-supported synthetic biology approach revealed a previously unknown correlation between oscillation fre-quency and gene dosage of clock components. Variable timings of plasmid uptake constitute a major source of cell-to-cell variability of GFP expression. However, through the alignment of single-cell trajectories by using simplified models (see Supplementary Information), we estimated that GFP expression in control experiments varied by only about 20%. Previous studies pointed to stochasticity, or ‘noise’, as a principal reason for limiting accuracy in synthetic networks 20,21 . To estimate the impact of molecular noise on the mammalian oscillator, we established a detailed stochastic model (see Supplementary Information). Stochastic simulations show that, at least for low plasmid dosages, noise contributes substantially to the observed cell-to-cell variability in the period (Fig. 4c, d).

In addition, we find low-amplitude noise-induced oscillations for high plasmid dosages that are similar to those predicted for simplified oscillators 21 . This underlines the importance of stochastic effects on the quantitative behaviour of systems with complicated dynamics 22 . Prokaryotic clocks that were constructed previously 12–14 employed only transcription control elements, and it was not obvious whether a post-transcriptional control component in a mammalian circuit could enable autonomous and self-sustained oscillations. The recent discovery of antisense clock-gene transcripts suggests that mecha-nisms of gene regulation operating through antisense RNA may also be integral to the circadian clockwork and be more important than previously anticipated 23 . Using a novel network design combining an autoregulated positive transcription feedback with a two-step tran-scription cascade producing non-coding antisense RNA for trans-lation control, we achieved autonomous, self-sustained and tunable oscillation in mammalian cells. Besides providing insight into the dynamics of mammalian clocks, a more profound understanding of molecular time-keeping devices could foster therapeutic oppor-tunities in clock-related pathologies such as Huntington’s 24 and Alzheimer’s 25 diseases. METHODS SUMMARY Design of expression vectors. pcDNA3.1-Ub V76 –GFP enables the constitutive expression of the destabilized GFP variant Ub V76 –GFP 26 . pMT35 (P hCMV * -1 R tTA r P PIR ) contains an expression unit for the P hCMV * -1 -driven sense and P PIR -driven antisense expression of tTA 17,27 . pMT35 was constructed by replacing p27 Kip1 of pMF226 (ref. 27) with tTA of pSAM200 by using EcoRI/ HindIII. pMT36 (P hCMV * -1 -PIT), engineered for P hCMV * -1 -driven PIT 17 express-ion, was constructed by elimination of the NotI fragment from pMF125 (ref. 28). pMT100 (P hCMV * -1 -Ub V76 –GFP), enabling the tetracycline-responsive express-ion of Ub V76 –GFP, was designed by inserting Ub V76 –GFP, excised from pcDNA3.1-Ub V76 –GFP by NheI/NotI, into the corresponding sites of pMF111 (ref. 29). pMF156 encodes the constitutive expression of PIT (P hCMV R PIT) 17 . Cell culture, transfection and gene regulation. CHO-K1 (ATCC CCL61) cells were cultivated in ChoMaster HTS (Cell Culture Technologies) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (lot no. P231902; Pan Biotech GmbH). Cells were cultivated at 30 u C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 , and 35,000 cells were transfected with up to 1.2 m g of plasmid mixtures by using the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (lot no. 93535720; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Fluorescence imaging. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy was performed with an inverted fluorescent microscope (DMI 6000B; Leica Microsystems) equipped with an incubation chamber, a DFC350FX R2 digital camera (Leica), a 10 3 objective (Obj. HC PL FL 10 3 /0.30 PH1 –/D 11.0; Leica) and a 488-nm/509-nm (B/G/R) Ub V76 –GFP-specific excitation/emission filter set. Time-lapse videos were produced with the LAS AF imaging software (FW4000-TZ; Leica) set to exposure times of 590–960 ms (auto-controlled depending to the mean fluorescence intensity level) every 3 min. Fluorescence was quantified with ImageJ software for at least 50 cells per condition. Computational modelling. All details of mathematical models and computa-tional methods are provided in Supplementary Information. Simulations were performed with MATLAB (MathWorks).
